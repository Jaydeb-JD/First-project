  <p> Many laptop computers use mobile processors and chipsets designed for the needs of mobile computers — primarily, low power usage. Low-power CPUs and GPUs help the battery last longer and produce less heat, making them more comfortable to use. However, even though laptops are far more compact than desktop computers, they are not necessarily less capable. High-end laptop processors perform just as well as desktop processors, allowing professionals to work effectively from any location. They typically include several I/O ports, including multiple USB or Thunderbolt ports, and sometimes an HDMI port. Laptops can also connect to external displays and use USB and Thunderbolt hubs to expand connectivity, allowing one to serve as a desktop replacement that can travel when necessary.
