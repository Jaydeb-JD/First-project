        A laptop, also known as a notebook, is a portable computer with a built-in LCD screen, keyboard, and trackpad. A laptop's screen is on a hinge, which allows it to open up when in use and to close like a book to keep it safe when stowed away. A laptop computer also includes a battery that allows it to run anywhere, regardless of whether or not there's a power outlet nearby. Built-in Wi-Fi networking, and in some cases LTE or 5G cellular connectivity, allows a laptop to connect to and browse the Internet without any wires at all.
